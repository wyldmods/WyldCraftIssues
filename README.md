Common Reports
---------------

Q: Why can't I use VeinMiner? 
A: VeinMiner is now an enchant. You must have the enchant for it to function, the keybind is the grave(~`) key.

Q: Why am I not getting hats when killing a mob? 
A: Hats are earned after spending time in the game. The first hat is recieved after 15 minutes, the next is 15 + n% and so on. Hats will still appear on mobs, but you can't kill them for hats.

Q: Why are there missing textures for KitchenCraft/CustomThings? 
A: You need to enable the resource packs.
